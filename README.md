Flashcard App
A beginner-friendly Flashcard Application built in Java as a learning project. This project was designed to practice fundamental Java programming concepts and improve problem-solving skills while creating a simple, functional tool.

Purpose
This project was created to:

Practice Java basics, such as Scanner for input handling and file management.
Apply object-oriented programming principles (classes, objects, encapsulation).
Explore the process of building an interactive application using simple coding concepts.
Features
Simple Flashcard System:
Add questions and answers to create a flashcard deck.
View questions and reveal answers to test your knowledge.
Text-Based Input: Designed with a console-based interface using Scanner for user interaction.
Save and Load Decks: Save flashcards to a text file and load them back for review.
Concepts Practiced
This project focuses on practicing:

Java Core Concepts:
Input handling with Scanner
File I/O for saving/loading flashcards
Object-Oriented Programming:
Designing classes for Flashcards and Decks
Encapsulation and methods for managing flashcard data
Control Structures:
Loops and conditionals for user navigation
Error Handling:
Validating user input and managing file operations
